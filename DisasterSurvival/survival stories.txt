Writing notes:
	Visualize the scene, then write only what's necessary for the reader to visualize it as well

	Everything in past tense (more natural to write/reads better)
	Goals- constant tension: always something important that the characters are trying to accomplish.  
	Mystery- Always have unanswered and interesting questions:
		Whats up with so-and-so's history?
		Mysterious item? whats that about?
		Whats the main cause/source of the disaster?
		Is there a way to fix the disaster?
	Consistent characters?
		-Characters should only be involved in stories that are suitable for them.  Characters should behave uniquely
	Describe effect of emotions and situation, not the emotions themselves. (Let them be apparent from context)
	Cut out anything redundant or unnecessary to the scene.  
	Foreshadowing

	Whenever something happens as a result of a players choice or a character's stats give some indication as to why they were successful or not

Gameplay Notes:
	Players will often have to choose what items to take with them.  Bartering with other survivors should happen reasonably often
	
Story lines

Any story lines where characters cooperate will strengthen their bonds
Where they fight or are separated will weaken bonds
## - story marker
##& - repeatable story line
unjustified fight/steal option hurts loyalty of ethical people, reduced penalty if action is justified
lack of fighting will hurt loyalty of unethical people


Overarching plots:
alien invasion, nucular war, foreign invaders, massive earthquake, zombies, deadly disease, only 10% survive
(secret everything at once option: aliens invade causing the other problems)

Base discovery solo:
	find a large empty warehouse (boring base, metal doors, no windows, no supplies)
	find a two story house (zombie family inside...sad) (pictures of family foreshadow the zombie attack)
	fire station (good defence, maybe weapons)
	RV (very poor location, small size)

Introductions::

Crazy + fighter intro
	Encounter some zombies, avoid them, return later and they are dead... Find more zombies, try to avoid them but they notice player, crazy person appears and kills zombies

parent+small child pair

zombies:
	a few different ways to start; Various discussions about the role/ effect of the zombie disease.  The disease 
	effectively puts a person to sleep and they are effectively sleepwalking.  
Eventually meet up with a scientist, he suggests that the infection might be preventable with a large dose of 
adrenalin.  The scientist dies, of course.  A character gets a chance to test the theory, it only half works.  
The virus still effects them but they retain their humanity.  More discussions about the disease and the 'cure'.
Eventually someone in the group decides to use it on a zombie that has been effected for a while.  They end up waking
up the person, they have some of their memories but can't control their killing urges.  The medicine wears off after
a little while.
