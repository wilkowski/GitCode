getting into a fight, grab nearest object: its something totally harmless (a spoon?)

"[His] hand reached backwards along the countertop as he kept his eyes fixed on the attacker.  [He] felt something metal brush against his figertips, a cutting knife he had seen on the counter earlier.  [He] grasped it tightly in his hand and as his attacker stepped forward he threw [his] hand around bringing the knife up to [his] enemy's face.  [His] attacker paused for a moment and then started to laugh.  [Name] looked again at what he held in [his] hand, shiny and metal ending in a rounded tip, an ordinary spoon, not the knife [he] was expecting.  Realizing [his] opponent was momentarily distracted, [he] thrust [his] hand forward, jabbing the spoon into the man's face.  \"Ow, The Fuck!\", [his] attacker raised his hands to bat away [Name]'s arm and cover his injured eye.  [Name] realized that this might be a good time to run.  "


Zombie mode staring
"[Name] awoke suddenly, dripping with sweat.  [He] remembered [he] was being chased somewhere dark, they were right on [his] heels, but when [he] looked back the shadowy figures were always just outside [his] view.  [He] concentrated, trying to recall what had led [him] to that situation but a knocking sound took [his] attention away, the memory of the dream slipping from [his] mind.  [He] rolled over in [bed] and tried to fall back asleep but the knocking sound came again.  \"Probably just a tree branch\" [he] thought.  The knocking came again and [he] looked out the window, the yellow glow of the street light was perfectly still through the branches of the tree, it was a perfectly quite night except for the knocking sound.  Feeling a sense of unease, [he] forced [him]self out of bed and walked slowly down the hallway to the front door.  Peering through the peep-hole, [he] could see only the porch and dark shadows on the ground.  [He] turned to go back to bed but heard the knocking again, this time he could clearly tell that it had come from outside where he had just looked seconds ago.  "


Zombie mode 2p romantic raid
"... [Name] grabbed [her1] hand and pulled [her1] along, running into the cottage and slamming the door behind them, \"Quick, get me something to bar the door!\" [he] yelled.  [She1] grabbed a thick log from next to the fireplace and tossed it to [him], \"This is the best I can do\".  [He] wedged the log into the door handle as well as [he] could manage \"This should hold them off for a few minutes, lets take a quick look around\".  \"Right!\" [she1] says, staying close to [him], [she1] produces a flashlight and shines it around the cottage. \"Fuck, not seein' much here...unless I'm missin' something?\" [she1] asks [him].  There are a few windows that would be impossible to properly barricade in time as well as some light furniture and useless knick-knacks around the cottage. [He] notices a gleam of metal on the floor. \"Hey! Over here!, it looks like a trapdoor to a cellar or something\" [He] points to a metal ring attached to a section of the wood floor.  A zombie appears outside the window and begins banging on the glass.  [He] grabs the ring and manages to pull the heavy door open, \"Get in, quick!\".  [Name1] runs over as [He] holds the door open and shines [his1] flashlight down into the hole, revealing a dirt floor about 10 feet down a ladder and a few shelves.  [She1] puts [his1] flashlight away and starts to climb down the ladder, but a sudden sound of glass breaking causes [him1] to loose [his1] footing and fall down on to the dirt floor. \"FUCK! OWW!\" [She1] screams.  [Name] looks over at the zombie that has broken through the window and is now climbing through.  \"Shit Shit Shit Shit\", [He] mutters loudly as [he] tosses [his] bag down into the cellar.  The zombie has climbed through the window and is rapidly approaching [him] as [he] climbs down the ladder, closing the trap door just before the zombie's rotten hand reached [him].  The zombie is scratching at the floor as [Name] holds the trapdoor shut.  [He] calls down to [Name1], \"Hey, are you ok?\".  [She1] calls back up to him \"Yeah, It hurt quite a bit but I don't think anything is broken, but my ass is going to be sore for a few days.\"  [Name] continues to hold the trapdoor shut as the zombie above scratches at it.  After a few minutes the scratching subsides and the slow dragging footsteps of the zombie can be heard.  [Name] climbs quietly down the ladder and sits next to [Name1] huddled in the darkness, [he] whispers, \"It looks like it can't figure out how to open the trapdoor so we should be fine for now.\"  [Name1] whispers back, \"I sure hope so.  If we stay here for a few hours most of the zombies will probably wander away.\"  A few minutes pass in silence before [Name1] ventures to turn on [his1] flashlight to examine their temporary shelter. They are sitting on a squat dirt floor in a small room with some metal shelves of assorted foodstuffs. \"Well, fuck me, this sucks!\" [she1] mutters. [She1] turns toward [him]. \"All right, guess it's okay to whisper while waiting for the zombie assholes to go away. So, what's your story?\".  [Name] sits for a moment in silence, nothing can be heard from the zombie above them, [he] replies back quietly, \"[history0]\"  [She1] nods, \"For me, [history1]\" [Name1] sighs and bangs the back of [his1] head against the packed earth walls. \"FUCK, what I wouldn't give for a drink and a smoke right now...\" [Name] looks around the cellar in the dim light, \"Well whoever used to live here probably won't be needing this anyway\" [he] says, nabbing a bottle of wine off a nearby shelf, \"not much I can do about the smoke though\". [Name1] perks up. \"Holy fuck, how did you--never mind, shit I think I got a corkscrew in this damn thing.\" [She1] produces a multi-tool and hurriedly flips out the corkscrew. \"Got it!\" [she1] says, louder than [she1] intended to. [She1] uncorks it, and passes the bottle to [him]. \"Finders get first pull.\" [she1] whispers, smiling. \"Thanks\" [he] smiles back and takes a too large swig of the bottle causing [him] to have a small coughing fit. \"Here\" [he] hands the bottle back to [him1].  \"Thanks!\", [she1] beams and take a large drink, making gulping noises. \"Ahhhhh!\" [she1] giggles and [his1] cheeks flush, as the booze immediately takes hold. \"That's some good shit!\", [she1] giggles again, passing the half-empty bottle back to [him]. \"I'm glad you like it\", [he] takes another smaller sip of the bottle and then sets it down between them \"Doesn't seem like the zombies can hear us down here.\" [She1] lifts the bottle to [his1] lips and take another, though smaller, drink. \"Heey, 'm glad I'm not alone down here. I would have been dead by now if not for you\" [she1] says slurring [her1] speech and wavering slightly in the dim light. \"So, yeah, again, thanks...\" [she1] put [her1] hand on [his] knee. [He] smiles and move over closer to [her1], putting [his] hand on [her] side. \"I'm glad you're here too, I mean, strength in numbers, yah' know?\". [she1] leans [her1] body against [his], and unusual maneuver for [her1]. [She1] closes [her1] eyes for a second, then mutters through wet lips. \"So, yew wanna fuck?\" [He] blushes, [his] mind a little fuzzy from the booze. \"Might as well, who knows if we'll still be alive tomorrow\" "
