TODO LIST FOR GAME:

fix popup repositioning when page is scrolled down
Make buttons be disabled while they are growing so you cant accidentally click one


MATH SUPER PROJECT
	Special research project has a chance of appearing if math level is high enough
		(twin prime research, or colatz conjecture, odd perfect numbers)
		gildbreath's conjecture: repeated prime differences = 1
	When completed unlocks math super
	Math super project
	insight button is enabled for 2 seconds out of every 15 seconds, disabled on click, +1 insight

	Research areas:
		solution to navier-stokes equation: improves physics? 50%
		no solution to navier-stokes: improve math?
		P=NP: massive money/s boost (but not $1M), 10% chance
		P!=NP: small money/s boost, 90% chance
		Reimann Hypothesis: + calculations/s boost
		Problem classification theorem: shows % chance of success for all research
			/i Provides a method to estimate the computational difficulty of a problem

	millenium problems all have $1mil prize

	Finished advanced math research, graduated school
	hit super project button (very large requirements, yes/ no option)
	a few research projects become available to try to prove or disprove.
		
	each has only one solution and each has a chance of failure
	research unlocks new theorems
	one theorem gives a permanent reward:
		+x% on all skill rewards
	ulocks [mathematical universe theorem]
	Build portal to new dimesion
	New dimension has little squiggles on some of the letters


Physics section:
	Basic physics
	Chemistry
	Advanced physics
	Quantum physics
	String theory
	Laser stuff
		Introduce materials for experiments: (straight up purchaseable item, flat price)
		(purchase 1x 10x 100x etc, buying 10 of one teir unlocks next one)
	

Special thing(s):
	Build experiment has %chance of success, can spend as much effort as you want building to success odds
	Silicon/transistor/cs experiemnt gives +5% code and +5% calc /s
	Pure physics experiment +improve odds of sucess for future experiments
	Material experiment: reduce material costs by 10%
	Money Experiment: earn permanent $/s

Engineering section:
	Heavy physics, materials, calculations requirements
	Special: Build stuff
	

//find better font for cs reset
//slightly better
//Nixie one? from google fonts: (does it do italics?)

Inspiration - Insipiration button appears next to muster for ~10 seconds (color/text countdown)
	Active for 30 seconds: all +skills clicks get +50% bonus
	Long ass cooldown ~ once per 15 min to 30 min?

create a navigation bar/favorites icon thingy (a graduation cap? a book?)

new layout for math/cs projects
Group projects together by type with box around them
	+/- button or ^ V button to expand/minimize box thingy (top left)
	label on box with description (after +/-)
	[finished/ (shown iff <total)]total item count (top right)


Stats/options menu (treat it like a tab button but place it on bottom row)
	show time played?
	import/export
	reset
	rename button (on next renameable button click get option to rename it)

Possible special reset effects:
	need glasses: (everything is slightly blurry until glasses purchased)
	Dating section: pick a person
		+relationship buttons
		marriage gives a bunch of bonuses to stuff depending on partner
	Chance to get into fight and lose a bunch of money

Do some animated text on button click:+skill thingy

british/english spelling? (flavour/ flavor, color/colour, analyze/analize)

update google drives site to redirect to scholarclicker.com

add web adress icon thingy for game

(add more cs classes)

Figure out how to make each button column be only as wide as necessary
(with some max width in case people put long names of stuff in)



Current milestone times:
	middle school:	2:40 min
	high school:	28:40 min
	college:	3 hrs
	grad school:	16 hrs
	graduation:	75 hrs
	ai buddy	180 hrs
	infinite nodes	330 hrs

SUPER PROJECT

	~10 mil effort cost


formula for X items of cost C and exponent E
infinite:
S = 1/E sum C*E^N from N = X to -infin
SE = 1/E sum C E^N from N=X+1 to -infin
SE-S = CE^X
S = CE^(X) / (E-1)
non infinite sum = CE^X+1 /1-E - CE/(E-1) = C/(E-1) * (E^(X) - 1)
current cs super costs:
	super computers: $ 166M
	bot nets: $48M, 16M code
	servers: $11M
		sum: $225M *5/6
			days: ~12 at best
	AI buddy:  12M effort, 30M code
		days: ~1.0, ~.3 days
	design: 1M effort, 2M code
	

possible super project rewards:
10% faster passage of time (time travel reward, [physics])
clicks count +1 times (alternate dimension? [math])
Earn interest on Calculations/Code/Money (Bad idea, interst is unfun)
//permanent /s bonus to a resource && add multiplier on resource max ([CS])
muster adds money



CS SUPER PROJECT
//	Gflops item needed
//	Get some ais, have graduated school
//	hit super project button (very large requirements, yes/ no option)
//	button opens up super project tab
//	a few programs need to be made and debugged
//		code analizer: less bugs show up in completed projects
//		self correcting code: bugs no longer show up in completed projects
//		self editing code: 
//	reward program opens up (gives permanent reward)
//		AI buddy = 50% bonus to a selected resource (calc/code)
//	self improving ai becomes available
//	each one reduces cost of next one (and other cs stuff maybe?)
//	when cost is at 0 and they go out of control you win the game
//	button appears that allows you to [enter the matrix]
//	button brings up yes/no menu
//	if yes, reset game keeping permanent bonus
	new game has new font

PHYSICS SUPER PROJECT
	Time dilator - permanent 15% bonus to speed
	Time machine - travel to the past
	Sepia tone on everything

Acheivements tab
	1 for each school up
	1 for each win
	for large numbers of stuff
	muster less win
	minimal other stuff wins
	graduate without cs/other classes
	graduate without cheating.  
	Multipling matricies: win cs multiple times


	
Add colors! (art class)
money -> dark green
effort -> dark yellow
calc -> dark red
code -> dark blue? (TODO: figure out code color)
bug-> red
in progress -> yellow
complete-> bright green
color highlighting for tabs

Icons for tabs and popups
effort->fist
money -> ($)
calculations -> [+-*/]
code -> circuit board?
math skill -> thought bubbled math equation?
cs skill -> thought bubbled code?


main section teaching job:
	no job option	(move tutoring here maybe?)
			startup effort cost
	math teacher: 	reward money/s based on math skill
			costs effort/s and calculations/s
	cs teacher:	reward money/s based on cs skill
			costs effort/s and code/s

God Mode tab (last thing to do):
	Requires All other acheivements
	Initially Show all true/false values and allow player to change them
	One of the bools unlocks larger god mode with acess to variables
	One of the variables unlocks access to full god mode with access to *everything*

Figure out what happens when numbers get too large & how to beat limits

Test in multiple browsers/window sizes

Test everything, test at normal speed

Physics section (also uses calculations)

Engineering section

Make grade up button dependencies depend on all skill levels (math level +5*cs level)
								(or multiply all cs levels by 5
Only for college +
in high school require pysics/x and math/x 

	Code Cleanup

Make each button have its own inner html data, -> do textify, counts automagically
(hard since innerHTML may contain other buttons, not really a requirement)

better tab highlighting when something new appears in them
fix popup bug (empty popup sometimes)

balance so that it is significantly faster to stick to one subject
	(completion amount of money takes a while if effort is divided, faster if focused)




/////////////Completed stuff

//set default font for end text

/donation button:
//	dogecoin 
		icons
//	paypal
//	bitcoin

//Adjust size of super project buttons

//Test what happens if math level gets over 9.9 bil

//Change self editing code to add progress to projects instead of fixing bugs

//force capitalization of project names

//make cancel button work for naming projects

//add google analytics

//math requirements for grade up should show up properly too
//(and or add more math classes corresponding to grade up requirements)

//added flavor text!
//flavor text on stuff!
//Remove button.disable, replace with is_disabled/color change
//Change button code so that there can be popups when button is disabled
//make poup move up or left if at bottom or right
//use undo on cs project cancel button
//test undo
//add in data for super project stuff

//grow stuff boxes (animate)

//export import buttons for saves, (helpful for testing too)

//round extra digits off of long numbers (like contest prizes)

//adjust grade up 1 cost to 4 or something easy like that (now start with enough effort)
