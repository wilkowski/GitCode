TODO LIST FOR GAME:

Put up on a website

add google analytics

balance math contest and math projects

CS_website does something?

CS_bonuses working

cs project bugs

FIX BUGS

Test in multiple browsers/window sizes

(donation button?)

Test everything, test at normal speed

//White background on footer bar (not required)

Make grade up button dependencies depend on all skill levels (math level +5*cs level)
								(or multiply all cs levels by 5

//Code Cleanup

Make each button have its own inner html data, -> do textify, counts automagically

Clean up button look/fix size bugs

Remove button.disable, replace with is_disabled/color change
	
add background to popup text	

move some stuff to separate files

make cs projects
	FEATURES:
	Exponential cost
	Gives a semi-permanent bonus to something (+$/s, calc/s, code/s, -bugs/s, etc)
	Player Names the project
	Random number of bugs appear =rand(current # -1)
	At each interval there is a small chance project will break 
		(requires small number of bug fixes to restore use)

Change button code so that there can be popups when button is disabled

better tab highlighting when something new appears in them
Clean up popup text code (see todo)
fix popup bug (empty popup sometimes)

balance so that it is significantly faster to stick to one subject
	(completion amount of money takes a while if effort is divided, faster if focused)


FINISHED (ish)

make math researches
	FEATURES:
	random name (if reasonable to do)
	random bonus to something (has a chance of no bonus = hit research dead end)
		bonus/chance of failure is based on math level
	already gotten bonuses are less likely
	exponential cost
	can start a bunch a once but not really useful to do so
