TODO LIST FOR GAME:

FIX BUGS

Test in multiple browsers/window sizes

Reset button confirmation
(donation button?)

Clean up button look/fix size bugs

Finish balancing math section
	Test everything, test at normal speed

make math researches
	FEATURES:
	random name (if reasonable to do)
	random bonus to something (has a chance of no bonus = hit research dead end)
		bonus/chance of failure is based on math level
	already gotten bonuses are less likely
	exponential cost
	can start a bunch a once but not really useful to do so
	

add background to popup text	

Make Math button dependencies depend on solely math level
Make grade up button dependencies depend on all skill levels

make cs projects
	FEATURES:
	Exponential cost
	Gives a semi-permanent bonus to something (+$/s, calc/s, code/s, -bugs/s, etc)
	Player Names the project
	Random number of bugs appear =rand(current # -1)
	At each interval there is a small chance project will break 
		(requires small number of bug fixes to restore use)

Change button code so that there can be popups when button is disabled

better tab highlighting when something new appears in them
Clean up popup text code (see todo)
fix popup bug (empty popup sometimes)

balance so that it is significantly faster to stick to one subject
	(completion amount of money takes a while if effort is divided, faster if focused)
