TODO LIST FOR GAME:
//fixed nasty math research bug
//Lots of balancing done yay
//new math classes
//added chalkboard

put all new files up on website

make cancel button work for naming projects
(alternately rework the way projects are named)

Put up on a website

add google analytics

math requirements for grade up should show up properly too
(and or add more math classes corresponding to grade up requirements)
(add more cs classes)

Figure out how to make each button column be only as wide as necessary
(with some max width in case people put long names of stuff in)

SUPER PROJECT
	new tab for super project items
	button to start super project

MATH SUPER PROJECT
	Finished advanced math research, graduated school
	hit super project button (very large requirements, yes/ no option)
	a few research projects become available to try to prove or disprove.
	each has only one solution and each has a chance of failure
	research unlocks new theorems
	one theorem gives a permanent reward: 
	ulocks [mathematical universe theorem]
	Build portal to new dimesion
	

CS SUPER PROJECT
	Get some ais, have graduated school
	hit super project button (very large requirements, yes/ no option)
	button opens up super project tab
	3 programs need to be made and debugged
	reward program opens up (gives permanent reward)
	self improving ai becomes available
	each one reduces cost of next one
	when cost is at 0 you win the game
	button appears that allows you to [enter the matrix]
	button brings up yes/no menu
	if yes, reset game keeping permanent bonus
	new game has new font

Acheivements tab
	1 for each school up
	1 for each win
	for large numbers of stuff
	muster less win
	minimal other stuff wins
	graduate without cs/other classes
	graduate without cheating.  
	
Add colors! (art class)
money -> dark green
effort -> dark yellow
calc -> dark red
code -> dark blue? (TODO: figure out code color)
bug-> red
in progress -> yellow
complete-> bright green
color highlighting for tabs

Icons for tabs and popups
effort->fist
money -> ($)
calculations -> [+-*/]
code -> circuit board?
math skill -> thought bubbled math equation?
cs skill -> thought bubbled code?


main section teaching job:
	no job option	(move tutoring here maybe?)
			startup effort cost
	math teacher: 	reward money/s based on math skill
			costs effort/s and calculations/s
	cs teacher:	reward money/s based on cs skill
			costs effort/s and code/s

#some level requirements on cs stuff? maybe not

more testing of cs project bugs

Do some animated text on button click+skill thingy

FIX BUGS

Figure out what happens when numbers get too large & how to beat limits

Test in multiple browsers/window sizes

(donation button?)

Test everything, test at normal speed

Physics section (also uses calculations)

Engineering section

Make grade up button dependencies depend on all skill levels (math level +5*cs level)
								(or multiply all cs levels by 5
Only for college +
in high school require pysics/x and math/x 

	Code Cleanup

Make each button have its own inner html data, -> do textify, counts automagically
(hard since innerHTML may contain other buttons, not really a requirement)

Clean up button look/fix size bugs

Remove button.disable, replace with is_disabled/color change
Change button code so that there can be popups when button is disabled
	

better tab highlighting when something new appears in them
Clean up popup text code (see todo)
fix popup bug (empty popup sometimes)

balance so that it is significantly faster to stick to one subject
	(completion amount of money takes a while if effort is divided, faster if focused)


FINISHED (ish)

make cs projects
	FEATURES:
	Exponential cost
	Gives a semi-permanent bonus to something (+$/s, calc/s, code/s, -bugs/s, etc)
	Player Names the project
	Random number of bugs appear =rand(current # -1)
	At each interval there is a small chance project will break 
		(requires small number of bug fixes to restore use)


make math researches
	FEATURES:
	random name (if reasonable to do)
	random bonus to something (has a chance of no bonus = hit research dead end)
		bonus/chance of failure is based on math level
	already gotten bonuses are less likely
	exponential cost
	can start a bunch a once but not really useful to do so
