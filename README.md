/BrilliantHungerGames folder for the programming competition https://brilliant.org/competitions/hunger-games/rules/
Both files are my own work, started with the example code provided by the website.  

/CritterGame Folder: learning simple fast media library to make a simple game from scratch. Sprites made with gimp.
Controls: wasd
Game rules: you always push and pull adjacent rocks with every move.  Enemy moves toward you and pushes rocks to get to you.  At higher difficulties enemy will move 2 spaces per turn.

/DisasterSurvival Folder: [Current Version.](http://wilkowski.github.io/DisasterSurvival/index.html) A text based adventure game with dynamically generated content.  Try to survive in a zombie apocolapse

/EulerProblems: My python code solutions for problems 19-100 from https://projecteuler.net/.  

/GreaseMonkey folder contains my greasemonkey script:
MALRedditFormatting - my first greasemonkey script! my first javascript script! Automatically formats links on MAL to make them easier to share.  


/QCell Folder: [Current Version.](http://wilkowski.github.io/QCell/index.html) Online workspace for working with esoteric qcell programming language.  I designed this language during college and recently created this webpage to easily and visually work with it.  The language itself simulates a neural network and can run any calculation.  It would be turning complete with the addition of an infinite tape/memory; memory can also be made with a large number of cells and connections.  

/RobotGame Folder: code for robotgame bots, simple script for robots in an online programming competition

/TheScholar Folder: [Current Version.](http://wilkowski.github.io/TheScholar/index.html) Entire ScholarClicker.com code base.  My first foray into designing and developing a webgame.  The game starts out simply with a single button and though many clicks more and more content is unlocked.  Game is designed with increasing complexity to encourage long term gameplay.
