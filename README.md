All the code I'm publishing on Github

Both files are my own work, started with the example code provided by the website.  

/GreaseMonkey folder contains my greasemonkey script:
MALRedditFormatting - my first greasemonkey script! my first javascript script! Automatically formats links on MAL to make them easier to share.  

/CritterGame Folder: learning simple fast media library to make a simple game from scratch. Sprites made with gimp.
Controls: wasd
Game rules: you always push and pull adjacent rocks with every move.  Enemy moves toward you and pushes rocks to get to you.  At higher difficulties enemy will move 2 spaces per turn.
